TMT25 - Test application for the development of a Trail Making Test, a neuropsychological test to help determine if a subject has dementia.

# Running the application
Node.JS is required. 

1) Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
2) cd into client folder and run 'npm install' again to install React dependencies.
